Crypto Confindence Wallet App

Basic POC of a React Native App that interacts directly with the XRP ledger using the ripple-lib.js library

The App can be used for both Escrow payments and Basic transactions

Currently tested on android (install android studio and create an emulator) or connect your phone via USB
Should work on iOS (but not tested latest updates)
